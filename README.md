# Explanation

Suppose our target is to cover 80% of the points out of a total of $N$ points. The actual number of points being covered is denoted as $K$.

`k_enclose_rectangle_approx` uses a sliding window to calculate the minimal x-span and y-span required to cover $N \times \sqrt{0.8}$ points. Statistically, the joint region will approximately cover $K \approx N \times \sqrt{0.8} \times \sqrt{0.8} = N \times 0.8$ points. The time complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$.

`k_enclose_rectangle_exact` relies on a 2D sliding window to sweep over all regions that include exactly $N \times 0.8$ points, ensuring that $K = N \times 0.8$. The time complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$.

# Conclusion

1. Computational Efficiency:
   - The approximate method (k_enclose_rectangle_approx) demonstrates significantly faster execution times, especially noticeable with larger datasets (e.g., N=1000). This efficiency aligns with its time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$.
   - The exact method (k_enclose_rectangle_exact), with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, takes considerably longer to execute as N increases. For instance, it took approximately 0.84 seconds for N=1000, compared to milliseconds for the approximate method.
2. Accuracy in Point Coverage:
   - The exact method consistently covers the exact target number of points (e.g., 800 out of 1000 when aiming for 80% coverage).
   - The approximate method often falls short by a small margin, covering slightly fewer points than the target (e.g., 798 instead of 800). This discrepancy arises from its reliance on marginal distributions and the assumption that covering $N \times \sqrt{0.8}$ points in each dimension will result in approximately $N \times 0.8$ points overall.
3. Area of the Enclosing Rectangle:
   - The rectangles identified by the exact method generally have a smaller area compared to those from the approximate method. This difference indicates that the exact method is more precise in finding the minimal-area rectangle that encloses the desired number of points.
   - For example, in the uniform distribution with N=1000, the exact method found a rectangle with an area of approximately 0.7755, while the approximate methodâ€™s rectangle had an area of approximately 0.7788.
4. Scalability:
   - The performance gap between the two methods widens as the dataset size increases. While the approximate method scales efficiently with larger N, the exact method becomes impractically slow for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
